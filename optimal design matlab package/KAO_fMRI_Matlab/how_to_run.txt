To run the code:

(1) Download the following files from the websites

%%%% functions obtained from others
% spm_Gpdf.m --- function from SPM2 for generating canonical HRF
% spm_hrf.m --- function from SPM2 for generating canonical HRF
% gen_mseq.m --- function from Liu (2004) NeuroImage for generating m-sequence
% qadd.m --- function from Liu (2004) NeuroImage for generating m-sequence

(2) Use the following example code to assign parameter values

% Par_Assign.m --- example code with default parameter values for running the search
               --- can directly use this m-file to perform the search

(3) Run 'Par_Assign.m'
