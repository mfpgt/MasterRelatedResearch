===============================
Saturation threshold = 
Setting up variables
You entered 6 conditions  (event types) that will each be modeled with a regessor. 
 Note that if you enter 0 as a condition number, those events will not be modeled
 (they are assumed to be rest/inter-stimulus interval periods)

Contrasts entered. You entered matrix of 1 contrasts, with weights across 6 conditions.
 Contrasts:
     1     0     0     0     0     0

 ...adding one column to contrast matrix with weights of 0, to model the intercept
You entered a contrast weight vector across 1 contrasts
 	...No rests specified.
================== Parameters ======================
     Total stimuli in scan      : 36
     Fixed rest length in ITIs  : 
     Fixed Rest stimuli in scan : 0
     Num blank intervals        : 0
     Num of task conds          : 6
     Num stimuli each cond      : 6  6  6  6  6  6
