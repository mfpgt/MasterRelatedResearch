function spm_realign_ui(opt)
% Within Mode Image Realignment
%___________________________________________________________________________
%
% This routine realigns a time-series of images acquired from the same subject 
% using a least squares approach and a 6 parameter (rigid body) spatial 
% transformation.  The first image in the list specified by the user is used
% as a reference to which all subsequent scans are realigned.  The reference
% scan does not have to the the first chronologically and it may be wise to
% chose a 'representative scan' in this role.
%
% For fMRI data an additional adjustment is made to the data that removes
% a tiny amount of the movement-related confounds of these effects.
% However, it may be preferable to include the functions of the estimated
% movement parameters as confounds in the statistics part.
%
%
% Uses
% Primarily to remove movement artefact in fMRI and PET time-series (or more 
% generally longitudinal studies)
%
%
% Inputs
% A series of *.img conforming to SPM data format (see 'Data Format').  The 
% relative displacement of the images should be small with respect to their 
% resolution.  This is usually easy to ensure for functional images (e.g. 
% fMRI, PET SPECT).
%
%
% Outputs
% The parameter estimation part writes out ".mat" files for each of the
% input images.  The part of the routine that writes the resliced images
% uses information in these ".mat" files and writes the realigned *.img
% files to the same subdirectory prefixed with an 'r' (i.e. r*.img).  The
% details of the transformation are displayed in the results window as
% plots of translation and rotation.
% A set of realignment parameters are saved for each session, named:
% rp_*.txt.

%_______________________________________________________________________
%
% In addition to realigning (transforming the images according to a rigid
% body model) the time series there is the option of modelling the residual 
% movement related variance in an EPI (fMRI) time series that can be 
% explained by a model for suceptibility-by-movement interactions. This
% is given by the "Realign & Unwarp" option.
%
% Susceptibility artefacts in EPI time series is a consequence of the
% "field disturbances" caused by the presence of an object in the field.
% Susceptibility is a property of a material, and can be thought of as
% the "resistance" put up by that material against being magnetised.
% At the interface between materials with different susceptibility
% rather severe field disturbancies will ensue. I.e. the field is
% no longer nice and homogenous. Since varying field strenght (gradients)
% is used to encode position in MRI, these disturbances cause spatial
% misplacement of RF signal, i.e. geometric distortions. Because of
% the low bandwidth in the phase encode direction these distortions
% will be appreciable mainly in that direction (typically the Ant-Post
% direction). The distortions are noticable mainly near air-tissue
% interfaces inside the scull, i.e. near the sinuses and the auditory
% canals. 
%
% In these areas in particular the observed image is a severly warped 
% version of reality, much like a funny mirror at a fair ground. When 
% one moves in front of such a mirror ones image will distort in 
% different ways and ones head may change from very elongated to 
% seriously flattened. If we were to take digital snapshots of the 
% reflection at these different positions it is rather obvious that 
% realignment alone will not suffice to bring them into a common space. 
%
% The situation is similar with EPI images, and an image collected 
% for a given subject position will not be identical to that collected 
% at another. We call this effect suscebtibility-by-movement interaction. 
% The "Unwarp" toolbox is predicated on the assumption that the 
% suscebtibility-by-movement interaction is responsible for a sizeable 
% part of residual movement related variance.
%
% Assume that we know how the deformations change when the subject changes 
% position (i.e. we know the derivatives of the deformations with respect 
% to subject position). That means that for a given time series and a 
% given set of subject movements we should be able to predict the "shape 
% changes" in the object and the ensuing variance in the time series. 
% It also means that, in principle, we should be able to formulate the 
% inverse problem, i.e. given the observed variance (after realignment) 
% and known (estimated) movements we should be able to estimate how 
% deformations change with subject movement. 
%
% We have made an attempt at formulating such an inverse model, and at 
% solving for the "derivative fields". A deformation field can be thought 
% of as little vectors at each position in space showing how that particular 
% location has been deflected. A "derivative field" is then the rate of 
% change of those vectors with respect to subject movement. Given these 
% "derivative fields" we should be able to remove the variance caused by 
% the suscebtibility-by-movement interaction. Since the underlying model 
% is so restricted we would also expect experimentally induced variance 
% to be preserved.

%                        The Prompts Explained
%_______________________________________________________________________
%
% 'Number of subjects'
% Enter the number of subjects you wish to realign.
%
% For fMRI, it will ask you the number of sessions for each subject.
% In the coregistration step, the sessions are first realigned to
% each other, by aligning the first scan from each session to the
% first scan of the first session.  Then the images within each session
% are aligned to the first image of the session.
% The parameter estimation is performed this way because it is assumed
% (rightly or not) that there may be systematic differences
% in the images between sessions.
% The adjustment step (correcting for resampling artifacts) is also
% performed completely independantly between each of the fMRI sessions.
%
% 'Images, subject # ..'
% Select the scans you wish to realign. All operations are relative
% to the first image selected.
%
% ......... Note that not all of the following prompts may be used: .........
%
% 'Which option?'
% 	'Coregister only'
% 	Only determine the parameters required to transform each of the
% 	images 2..n to the same space as image 1.
% 	The determined parameters for image XXXX.img are saved in the
%	file XXXX.mat. This is a Matlab file, containing the matrix 'M'.
% 	The location of an image voxel (in mm) can be determined by
% 	computing M(1:3,:)*[xcoord ycoord zcoord 1].
%	Note that if the coregistration is performed more than once on
%	the unresliced data, the starting estimates are obtained from
% 	parameters stored in the '.mat' files.
%	Note that for PET, the coregistration is a two step process.
%	First of all, the images are all realigned to the first in
%	the series.  A mean of these realigned images is created, and
%	a second pass realignment is performed to realign all the
%	images to the mean. Finally, the parameters are corrected
%	for any differences estimated by registering the first image in
%	the series to the mean image.
%
% 	'Reslice Only'
% 	Reslice the specified images according to the contents of the
% 	previously determined parameters. The images are resliced to be
% 	in the same space as the first one selected.  For fMRI, this is
%	the first image of the first session.
%
% 	'Coregister & Reslice'
% 	Combine the above two steps together.
%
%
% Options for reslicing:
%
% 'Create what?'
% 	'All Images (1..n)'
% 	This reslices all the images - including the first image selected
% 	- which will remain in it's original position.
%
%	'Images 2..n'
% 	Reslices images 2..n only. Useful for if you wish to reslice
% 	(for example) a PET image to fit a structural MRI, without
% 	creating a second identical MRI volume.
%
%	'All Images + Mean Image'
% 	In addition to reslicing the images, it also creates a mean of the
% 	resliced image.
%
%	'Mean Image Only'
% 	Creates the mean image only.
%
%_______________________________________________________________________
%
%                           Defaults Options
%_______________________________________________________________________
%
% 'Registration Quality?'
% Quality versus speed trade-off.  Highest quality (1) gives most
% precise results, whereas lower qualities gives faster realignment.
% The idea is that some voxels contribute little to the estimation of
% the realignment parameters. This parameter is involved in selecting
% the number of voxels that are used.
% [defaults.realign.estimate.quality]
%
% 'Allow weighting of reference image?'
% Give the option of providing a weighting image to weight each voxel
% of the reference image differently when estimating the realignment
% parameters.  The weights are proportional to the inverses of the
% standard deviations.
% For example, when there is a lot of extra-brain motion - e.g., during
% speech, or when there are serious artifacts in a particular region of
% the images.
% [defaults.realign.estimate.weight]
%
%
% 'Reslice interpolation Method?'
% The method by which the images are sampled when being written in a
% different space.
%       'Nearest Neighbour'
%               - Fastest, but not normally recommended.
%       'Bilinear Interpolation'
%               - OK for PET, or realigned fMRI.
%
%       'B-spline Interpolation'
%               - Better quality (but slower) interpolation, especially
%                 with higher degree splines.  Don't use B-splines when
%                 there is any region of NaN or Inf in the images.
%       'Fourier space Interpolation'
%               - Rigid body rotations are executed as a series of shears,
%                 which are performed in Fourier space (Eddy et. al. 1996).
%                 Unfortunately, this method can only be applied to images
%                 with cubic voxels (since zooms can not be done by
%                 convolution in Fourier space). 
% [defaults.realign.write.interp]
%
% These are typically:
%       'No wrapping' - for PET or images that have already
%                       been spatially transformed.
%       'Wrap in  Y'  - for (un-resliced) MRI where phase encoding
%                       is in the Y direction (voxel space).
% [defaults.realign.write.wrap]
%
% 'Mask images?'
% Because of subject motion, different images are likely to have different
% patterns of zeros from where it was not possible to sample data.
% With masking enabled, the program searches through the whole time series
% looking for voxels which need to be sampled from outside the original
% images. Where this occurs, that voxel is set to zero for the whole set
% of images (unless the image format can represent NaN, in which case
% NaNs are used where possible). This is in order to avoid artifactual
% movement-related variance the realigned images.
% [defaults.realign.write.mask]
%
% Other Defaults are useful for making spm_realign_ui.m more flexible:
% [defaults.realign.estimate.interp] - interpolation method for parameter
% estimation.
% [defaults.realign.estimate.wrap] - wrapping used for parameter estimation.
% This should probably also influence the way that smoothing is done, but
% the smoothing code has not yet been modified to include wrapping.
%
%__________________________________________________________________________
%
% The `.mat' files.
%
% This simply contains a 4x4 affine transformation matrix in a variable `M'.
% These files are normally generated by the `realignment' and
% `coregistration' modules.  What these matrixes contain is a mapping from
% the voxel coordinates (x0,y0,z0) (where the first voxel is at coordinate
% (1,1,1)), to coordinates in millimeters (x1,y1,z1).  By default, the
% the new coordinate system is derived from the `origin' and `vox' fields
% of the image header.
%  
% x1 = M(1,1)*x0 + M(1,2)*y0 + M(1,3)*z0 + M(1,4)
% y1 = M(2,1)*x0 + M(2,2)*y0 + M(2,3)*z0 + M(2,4)
% z1 = M(3,1)*x0 + M(3,2)*y0 + M(3,3)*z0 + M(3,4)
%
% Assuming that image1 has a transformation matrix M1, and image2 has a
% transformation matrix M2, the mapping from image1 to image2 is: M2\M1
% (ie. from the coordinate system of image1 into millimeters, followed
% by a mapping from millimeters into the space of image2).
%
% These `.mat' files allow several realignment or coregistration steps to be
% combined into a single operation (without the necessity of resampling the
% images several times).  The `.mat' files are also used by the spatial
% normalisation module.
%__________________________________________________________________________
%
% The *uw.mat file.
%
% The *uw.mat file contains information about input to the Unwarp module 
% (i.e. how it was run) and about the result. It contains all the information
% needed to unwarp the appurtenant time-series, and to assess exactly how the
% estimation was done.
