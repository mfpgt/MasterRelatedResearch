subject 	hn120493

# 1/14/13 - 2:30-4:30
# fMRI first
# Practice was good
#	- Several errors however
#	- Run under 'Test' subject, so copied over after the fact
#	- Ran 18/30 trials
# First run broke because TTL returns 'x' and so program was exited
#	- Switched exit key to 'q' thereafter
# Localizer crashed because no hm_ stim file was made
#	- Renamed Test_stim file and ran 
# Log/data files saved as 'hm' for fMRI
# Eyetracker would not calibrate
