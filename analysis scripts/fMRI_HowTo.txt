-----------------
Setup needed to run the analysis

* Matlab path:
	- Needs to contain the analysis folder with the NM_*.m scripts
		- Also the experiment folder with the NeuroMod_*.m scripts
	- Also, needs to contain spm8

* Files from the experiment (in the fMRI project folder):
	- In the 'logs' folder, there should be a subject folder with:
		* The _log.txt file from the experimental run (named NIP_log.txt)
		* The _data.txt file from the experimental run (named NIP_data.txt)
		 	- NOTE: These should be cleaned such that any trials from aborted runs are removed
		* The .csv file used for the localizer
			- Renamed to NIP_localizer_list.csv
	- In the 'eye_tracking_data' folder, there should be a subject folder with:
		* Converted .asc files for each .edf file
			- They should be named NIP_run_#.asc and NIP_baseline.asc
		* If the eye tracker did not work, then these are obviously not needed

* fMRI_subject_notes.txt: Add a section for the subject with the following lines:
	* subject	NIP
	* rec_data	string	YYYYMMDD
		- This allows the scripts to find the fMRI data files
	* anat_scan	string	#
		- The run number for the anatomical scan
	* run_scans	string	# # # #
		- The run numbers for the experimental runs
	* loc_scan	string	#
		- The run number for the localizer run
	* resp_type	string	TYPE
		- Where TYPE is 'right' or 'left' depending on the settings during the experiment
	* NOTE: If the eye_tracker was not used (as was probably the case) add these lines as well:
		- eye_tracker	number	0
		- num_blinks	number	0
		- num_eye_movements	number	0
		- num_noise	number	0

-----------------
Proprocessing:

* Variables: In matlab, set the following global variables before running the analysis
	- GLA_fmri_dir: The directory of the fMRI project
		- For now: '/Users/Doug/Documents/neurospin/fmri'
	- GLA_subject: The subject NIP
		- Corresponds to the folder names in the project directory and the fmri data
	- GLA_rec_type: Set to 'fmri' (as opposed to 'meeg')

* NM_Import_Data: This function should find the raw data from the fmri server and copy it into the 'fmri_data' subject folder, with the following structure:
	- dcm2nii_script.sh: So far, I cannot get the dcm2nii script to run from matlab, so this must be done "manually"
		- After the .dcm files have been copied matlab will prompt the user to run this script from the command line
		- It will convert the copied .dcm files and leave behind only the following .nii files
	- localizer folder: 
		- NIP_anat.nii: The anatomical run
		- NIP_loc.nii: The localizer run
	- experiment folder: 
		- NIP_anat.nii: The anatomical run
		- NIP_run_#.nii: The experimental runs (1-4)

* NM_Check_Files: This will parse the output of the experiment to make sure everything is in order.
	- The results of the parsing will be stored in the global variable GLA_subject_data. This variable is then stored in the 'analysis' subject folder in the file NIP_subject_data.mat.
		- In general, this will store what and when was displayed during the experiment, and how the subject responded.
	- Also, this script should check the timing of the stimuli and store the results in 'analysis/NIP/NIP_timing_report.txt'

* NM_PreprocessData: Will perform the preprocessing on the responses, eye tracking data (if present), and the fmri data
	- Preprocessing the responses will mark behavioral outliers in the GLA_subject_data
	- Proprocessing the fmri data will, for both the localizer and experiment:
		- Create the design file (containing 'names','onsets', and 'durations') and save them in 'fmri_data/NIP/TYPE/NIP_design.mat'
		- Create and run the preprocessing spm batch to realign, segment, etc. the fmri data
			- The batch will be saved in 'fmri_data/NIP/TYPE/NIP_preprocess_batch.mat'
			- This will result in the usual intermediary .nii files in the 'fmri_data/NIP/TYPE' folders

* NM_PerformSanityChecks: Will produce the preliminary sanity checks for the data
	- For the responses, this will produce a graph the RT distribution with the accuracy data displayed
		- This graph will be saved in 'analysis/NIP/NIP_Behavioral_Sanity_Check.jpg'
	- For the fMRI data, this will:
		- Assess the movement during both the experiment and localizer and save the graphs to 'analysis/NIP/NIP_TYPE_movement_plot.jpg'
		- Perform the first level analysis on the localizer data, which will:
			- First create and run the design batch 
				- The batch is saved to 'analysis/NIP/localizer/normal/NIP_localizer_design_batch.mat
				- This will create the SPM.mat file and associated data files in the 'analysis/NIP/localizer/normal/' folder
			- Then, create and run the contrasts batch
				- The batch is saved to 'analysis/NIP/localizer/normal/NIP_localizer_contrasts_batch.mat
				- The initial contrasts are:
					- Finterest:
					- setence-pseudo: The contrast between the sentence and pseudo word blocks
					- setence+pseudo>0: The contrast between the experimental blocks and the baseline

* The experiment can then be analyzed by:
	- Setting the global variable GLA_fmri_type to 'experiment'
	- Running NM_AnalyzefMRIData
		- This will create the same design and contrast batches as for the localizer during the sanity checks
		- The initial contrasts are:
			- Finterest: 
			- structure: All of the phrase conditions (levels 2-4) vs. the list conditions (2-4)
			- linear_phrase: A linear contrast for the phrase conditions (1-4)
			- linear_list: A linear contrast for the list conditions (1-4)
			- interaction_phrase: linear_phrase - linear_list
			- interaction_list: linear_list - linear_phrase
			- big_phrase: The most extreme phrase condition alone (phrase 4)
			- all_phrases: All phrase levels (1-4)
			- all_lists: All list levels (1-4)
			- all: All conditions (phrase / list; levels 1-5)
